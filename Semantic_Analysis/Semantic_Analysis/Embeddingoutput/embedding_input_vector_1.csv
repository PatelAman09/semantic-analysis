  "machine learning focuses on developing algorithms that allow machines to improve their performance on a certain task over time through accumulating experiences.",
  "going back to beverly, her watch implements an ml algorithm to understand her voiced instructions.",
  "although the initial performance is not fully satisfying i.e.",
  "she had to repeat herself several times, the watch becomes betterover time asit experiencesmore instances ofbeverlys voice.modern companies thatbuild thesevoice-recognition systems often pre-train the algorithm with massive amounts of voice recordings covering a wide range of accents, volumes, and acousticenvironmentspriortosellingthemtothecustomers.theinitialaccuracyofthewatchsvoicerecognitionshouldbeaccept- able, but it is further improved by specically learning its owners voice.",
  "approaches to training although all ml approaches share the goal of automatically improving performance on a task based on accumulated experiences, they differ largely on the target task, the nature and availability of training data, and the measure of performance.",
  "given the complexity and variability of typical problems addressed with ml, there is no one-size-ts-all approach to training.",
  "although not a comprehensive list, the three largest categories are supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.",
  "supervised learning in supervised learning, the ml algorithms are trainedusing large collections of examples that are labeled with thecorrect answer. similar to how one studies for a test by completing endless practice problems, the algorithm learns how properly to identify or classify a given input by processing large, labeled datasets until it can do so with an elevated level of condencedthe larger the training set with rich and diverse examples, the more accurate the algorithm.",
  "a simple example of supervised learning involves training an algorithm to differentiate between images of cats and dogs.",
  "the training dataset consists of a huge selection of different images showing either a cat or dog, along with its correct label.",
  "the algo- rithm studiestheseexamplesbyidentifyingpatternswithinthepixels.then,whenprovidedwithanovelunlabeledimage,the algorithm willlook for similarpatterns andprovide ananswerdalthough best guess mightbemoreappropriatedandalevel of condence.now,whathappenswhenthealgorithm,trainedonnothingbutcatsanddogs,isgivenanimageofarabbit?thereare certainlysimilaritiesthatcouldbedrawnbetweenrabbits,cats,anddogs,butthealgorithmcanonlychoosebetweenthelattertwo animals.",
  "it will have to choose whichever category the rabbit image most closely resembles, but the condence of the result will likely be low.",

  "containing accurate human coders labels with unbiased and diverse training examples are not available, it can take hundreds of hours for humans to collect and label a new training set.",

  "unsupervised learning whenwell-labeleddataisunavailableandthetaskofcreatingalabeleddatasetisneitherphysicallynornanciallyfeasible,orwhen one is without preconceived categories or unsure what to even look for, unsupervised learning may be the ideal approach.",
  "the unsupervised approach allows the algorithm to detect patterns that may be too complex for a human to recognize.",
  "the algorithm reads the unlabeled data and discovers hidden patterns within.",
  "for instance, the construction of a commercial airliner involves millions of mechanical parts.",
  "each part of the aircraft will have adegreeoferrorinlength,weight,orperformanceduetosimplevariationinqualitycontroldallpiecesmeetingaminimumstan- dard,butnotperfect.eventhoughallpartsindividuallymayworkwithoutperceivableerror,inacomplexmachinelikeanaircraft, theaccumulatederror maybecatastrophic.",

  "thedriving algorithm is given astraightforward goal drive from point a to pointb without accident andbefore time runs out.",
  "any behaviors that progress toward meeting the goal are rewarded while the rest are penalized.",
  "the algorithm starts with random actionsand,forawhile,mightnotevenmoveforward.however,afterthousandsofrandomtrials,thealgorithmbeginstousethe gas pedal to move forward not backwards because moving forward closes the gap between point a and point b, but it may not have learned yet how to use the steering wheel to turn.",
  "after running off the road, hitting stationary objects, making u-turns, and another million failed trials, the algorithm nally begins to guide the car to its destination.",
  "the cost of reinforcement learning is computational resources and time in simulated environments, which is relatively inexpensive and more efcient compared to crashing cars on a real road or collecting data on even 100 real drivers.",
  "supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning are currently the most well-known approaches in ml.",
  "other more complex approaches derive from these basic approaches.",
  "for example, semi-supervised learning and self-supervised learning combine both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, such as using the results from unsupervised learning to inform labeling in supervised learning datasets.",
  "additional ml approaches e.g.",
  "ensemble learning, active learning, transfer learning strive strategically to improve the performance of the basic approaches.",
  "these techniques do not have to be supervised, unsupervised or reinforcement learning, but they do employ strategies to improve the performance of any single model.",
  "for instance, ensemble learning combines multiple classiers and then outputs more robust results compared to simpler approaches.",
  "active learning can involve a human coder to resolve uncertain cases.",
  "and transfer learning, in some instances, can use pre-tuned model parameters to shorten the training time or deal with problems with fewer training examples needed.",
  "insummary,mlisanappliedeldanddifferentapproachesareinspiredbydiversepracticalproblemsacrossvariousdisciplines.",
  "therefore, these approaches do not necessarily all share the same theoretical foundation and historical root.",
  "each approach to ml has developed a multitude of different algorithms for different purposes.",
  "this diversity began during the mid-20th century and continues to evolve today.",
  "a brief history of machine learning as early as 1947, the british mathematician alan turing envisioned a machine that could, based on an initial set of instructions, modify its own operating instructions over time.",
  "the new instructions created by the machine were the result of responses to recently added information.",
  "he likened the process to students who have learned basic information from their teachers and went on to develop new knowledge on their own.",
  "insuch acaseone would havetoadmit thatthe progress ofthemachinehadnot beenforeseen whenits original instructionswereputin.it wouldbe like a pupil who had learnt much from his master but had added much more by his own work.",

  "machine learning 85 international encyclopedia of education, fourth edition, 2023, 8391",
  "turings idea was too theoretical and abstract to implement in 1947, but todays development of ml is largely inspired by his vision.",
  "with modern technology, turings ideas have come to fruition.",
  "oneoftheearliestpracticalexamplesoflearningmachinesisoftenattributedtoarthursamuel.inthe1950s,samueldeveloped a computer program that could learn to play the game checkers, a strategic board game where two players make diagonal moves and capture pieces by jumping over the opponent.",

  "originating in ancient china, go is a vastly more complicated game with 361 potential opening moves compared to checkers four moves or chess twenty moves.",
  "brute-force assessment of every possible next move in go, as is done in simpler algorithms used for checkers and chess, is beyond the computational power of any computer in existence.",

  "now, having laid a foundation about ml in general, we next describe how ml can be used in education.",
  "machine learning in education at its core, the purpose of ml is to solve problems and offer insight into issues too complex for human analysis, or to automate routines too costly for human labor.",
  "successful implementation of ml algorithms reduces the reliance on human effort by auto- mating complicated or tedious tasks.",
  "in education, there are many such tasks that could benet from ml.",
  "for instance, a report published by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd in 2015 found that teachers spend, on average, about half as much time teaching as they do on non-teaching tasks including lesson planning, grading, administrative work, and collaboration with other teachers.",
  "moreover, teachers struggle to provide equal attention to all students in addition to preparing high quality instructional activities to classrooms of 30 students.",

  "the ethical issues of mass data collection and the overall use of ml and ai are current global concerns, but when dealing with vulnerable populations like young students, extra caution must be taken before ml can fully take off in education.",
  "like any major advancement, the future of machine learning, and its benets, will face hurdles we must surmount.",
  "concerns moving forward as we move toward this new world of smart machines, the ethics of ml must remain at the forefront of progress.",
