  "approaches to training although all ml approaches share the goal of automatically improving performance on a task based on accumulated experiences, they differ largely on the target task, the nature and availability of training data, and the measure of performance.",
  "given the complexity and variability of typical problems addressed with ml, there is no one-size-ts-all approach to training.",
  "although not a comprehensive list, the three largest categories are supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.",
  "supervised learning in supervised learning, the ml algorithms are trainedusing large collections of examples that are labeled with thecorrect answer. similar to how one studies for a test by completing endless practice problems, the algorithm learns how properly to identify or classify a given input by processing large, labeled datasets until it can do so with an elevated level of condencedthe larger the training set with rich and diverse examples, the more accurate the algorithm.",

  "the cost of reinforcement learning is computational resources and time in simulated environments, which is relatively inexpensive and more efcient compared to crashing cars on a real road or collecting data on even 100 real drivers.",
  "supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning are currently the most well-known approaches in ml.",
  "other more complex approaches derive from these basic approaches.",
  "for example, semi-supervised learning and self-supervised learning combine both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, such as using the results from unsupervised learning to inform labeling in supervised learning datasets.",
  "additional ml approaches e.g.",
  "ensemble learning, active learning, transfer learning strive strategically to improve the performance of the basic approaches.",
  "these techniques do not have to be supervised, unsupervised or reinforcement learning, but they do employ strategies to improve the performance of any single model.",
  "for instance, ensemble learning combines multiple classiers and then outputs more robust results compared to simpler approaches.",
  "active learning can involve a human coder to resolve uncertain cases.",
  "and transfer learning, in some instances, can use pre-tuned model parameters to shorten the training time or deal with problems with fewer training examples needed.",
  "insummary,mlisanappliedeldanddifferentapproachesareinspiredbydiversepracticalproblemsacrossvariousdisciplines.",
  "therefore, these approaches do not necessarily all share the same theoretical foundation and historical root.",
  "each approach to ml has developed a multitude of different algorithms for different purposes.",
  "this diversity began during the mid-20th century and continues to evolve today.",
  "a brief history of machine learning as early as 1947, the british mathematician alan turing envisioned a machine that could, based on an initial set of instructions, modify its own operating instructions over time.",
  "the new instructions created by the machine were the result of responses to recently added information.",
  "he likened the process to students who have learned basic information from their teachers and went on to develop new knowledge on their own.",
  "insuch acaseone would havetoadmit thatthe progress ofthemachinehadnot beenforeseen whenits original instructionswereputin.it wouldbe like a pupil who had learnt much from his master but had added much more by his own work.",

  "turings idea was too theoretical and abstract to implement in 1947, but todays development of ml is largely inspired by his vision.",
  "with modern technology, turings ideas have come to fruition.",
  "oneoftheearliestpracticalexamplesoflearningmachinesisoftenattributedtoarthursamuel.inthe1950s,samueldeveloped a computer program that could learn to play the game checkers, a strategic board game where two players make diagonal moves and capture pieces by jumping over the opponent.",

  "now, having laid a foundation about ml in general, we next describe how ml can be used in education.",
  "machine learning in education at its core, the purpose of ml is to solve problems and offer insight into issues too complex for human analysis, or to automate routines too costly for human labor.",
  "successful implementation of ml algorithms reduces the reliance on human effort by auto- mating complicated or tedious tasks.",
  "in education, there are many such tasks that could benet from ml.",
  "for instance, a report published by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd in 2015 found that teachers spend, on average, about half as much time teaching as they do on non-teaching tasks including lesson planning, grading, administrative work, and collaboration with other teachers.",
