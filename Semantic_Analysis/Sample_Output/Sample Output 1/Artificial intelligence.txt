Artificial intelligence encompasses machine learning, a field dedicated to developing algorithms that can recognize patterns and make decisions based on data. These models are crafted to improve their performance over time without requiring direct programming instructions. Machine learning is typically classified into three main categories: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
Supervised learning depends on labeled data, where models learn from input-output relationships. In contrast, unsupervised learning identifies patterns and structures in data without requiring predefined labels. Reinforcement learning trains agents by rewarding positive behaviors and discouraging negative ones, enabling optimal decision-making.
Machine learning applications extend across multiple domains, such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous vehicles. In healthcare, it supports disease diagnosis and personalized medicine. In finance, it enhances fraud detection, risk analysis, and algorithmic trading. Autonomous vehicles rely on machine learning to analyze sensor inputs and navigate safely.
